## Project Description
**Project 0: NBody Simulation Project**
-   Object Oriented crash course project to get started with Java. 
-   In this project you create a solar system simulation of the 8 planets revolving around Sun using StdDraw.

**Project 1A: Data Structures**
-   Implemented a double ended queue using Linked Lists and Arrays. 

**Project 1B: Unit Testing and HOF**
-   Wrote extensive unit tests and implemented higher order functions to verify accuracy of the double ended queue built in Project 1A.

## Tools Used
- Java 15
- JUnit
- Intellij IDEA
- Java Visualizer

This MOOC would not have been possible without the brilliant lecture series by Professor Josh Hug and the UCB for providing the course resources for free. 

Additionally, the [r/learnJava] (https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava/) subreddit and discord group Java MOOC acted like TAs when I was stuck on critical problems. If anybody is looking to take this course be sure to check them out.
